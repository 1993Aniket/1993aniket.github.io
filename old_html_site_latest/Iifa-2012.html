<h4>Environment</h4>
<p>The International Indian Film Academy is an organisation dedicated to promoting Indian Cinema beyond India and placing it on an international platform by fostering exchange and interaction to enhance business opportunities. IIFA has grown from ‘One Amazing Night’ to a three-day weekend, which celebrates and hosts various events and activities. Each year IIFA has seen an increase in participation over the 3-day weekend from the industry over which, press conferences, celebrity special events, IIFA world premieres, a FICCI-IIFA global business forum, IIFA film festival, IIFA workshop and the ultimate in glitz - the IIFA awards presentation ceremony takes place.</p>
<p>Through the ‘Weekend and Awards’, IIFA connects fans to their favourite stars through a host of events. Awards ceremonies recognize the finest in Indian cinema and are watched by millions on television.</p>
<p>In order to achieve its mission, IIFA has travelled through London, South Africa, Malaysia, and Singapore, to Amsterdam, Dubai, Yorkshire, Thailand, Macao and Sri Lanka. IIFA 2011 was held in the Canadian city of Toronto.</p>
<p>The PR Agency works closely with IIFA in order to showcase the talent and brilliance that Indian cinema offers the world. The effort also helps spread the magic of Indian cinema around the world, thus creating bonds between people, film industries, and countries.</p>

<h4>Agency Brief</h4>

<li>Widen the reach of Hindi cinema whilst garnering a global audience and engaging it with a wide-spread media reach  </li>
<li>	Mark IIFA’s foray into North America and the biggest celebration of Indian cinema in Canada</li>
<li>	Showcase IIFA as a world-class event via a large convergence of worldwide media</li>
<li>	Deliver an impactful message to viewers and readers about IIFA, the host country and long term benefits</li>
</ul>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<ul>
  <li>	To showcase a prolific and successful IIFA 2011 in Toronto, Canada </li>

</ul>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<p>From a PR perspective, the following are some of the biggest challenges we faced when trying to execute the media relations campaign for IIFA 2011:</p>
<ul>
  <li>	Star availability – Gaining access to film stars and personalities, and scheduling interviews and media interactions with them in order to drive coverage. </li>
  <li>	Making media understand the fact that as a body, IIFA is not yet another award ceremony but a well-coordinated effort to promote Indian cinema globally</li>
  <li>	International Destination – Though the popularity of Indian cinema is growing at an exponential rate in North America, it remains an uncharted territory where traditions, culture, people and the media scenario is different when compared to India</li>
  <li>	In contrast to North America, previous IIFA host destinations were easier to access and understand and offered the agency a higher concentration of Indian cinema fans</li>
  <li>	Since regional media make up a large segment of the media in India, their role in writing about IIFA was critical to the success of the event</li>
  <li>	To ensure that exciting and newsworthy coverage about IIFA appeared in different Indian publications right through the six month period</li>
  <li>	Hosting a large Indian media contingent and ensuring they are well taken care of</li>
  <li>	The IIFA Awards are one of the most glamorous and awe-inspiring award ceremonies in the world. This fact needed to be understood and written about well by the Indian media</li>
</ul>
<h4>Strategic Approach</h4>
<ul>
  <li>	Garnering interest from mainstream media through exclusive coverage, healthy attendance, and regular interaction with stars and the IIFA Team</li>
  <li>NGOs & Charity Angle – involved tremendous participation from corporate houses and Bollywood personalities </li>
  <li>	The campaign followed an umbrella messaging structure that revolved around creating strategic communication across key mainstream and regional publications, magazines, the online space, and television networks. The plan comprised of proactive and reactive PR activities to maintain an exciting and newsworthy profile of the events in the Indian media</li>
  <li>The umbrella campaign also ensured a consistent stream of visibility within positioning media, up-weighted with the support of photographs and press information in the form of media releases</li>
  <li>	Categorically targeting regional publications across the country, providing them with well-translated information packs about IIFA over the years along with a plethora of pictures in order to garner feature stories</li>
  <li>	Reaching out to media laterally, vertically, aligned to target audiences, and assessed in accordance to audience media consumption patterns</li>
  <li>	In addition to the on-going PR activity, we implemented individual sub-campaigns promoting specific facets of the IIFA campaign directed by the India team</li>
  <li>	IIFA sponsored columns in targeted newspapers and magazines</li>
  <li>Strengthening IIFA’s key attributes being global, glamorous and credible thus establishing it as a truly unique event</li>

<p> 
Having worked with other major PR firms, it was quite an unusual practice to liaise with a boutique company but we were pleasantly surprised that the kind of attention to detail and dedication we received from Zzebra PR (now Concept PR)  was exceedingly useful and added an invaluable advantage to having them as a agency. Over the past year, we have found them to be extremely competent and we credit much of our IIFA 2011 publicity in the country to their expertise and nationwide reach. We were pleased with their handling of the Indian region of the IIFA campaign. Their unwavering work for IIFA 2011 made for a value of over 80 million USD. They are extremely accommodating, affable and above all things, reliable and timely. Zzebra has proven time and again their unvarying<br /> assistance and support through the few hectic months and pertinent to the <br />Indian media contingent’s travel, hospitality and overall lookout.
